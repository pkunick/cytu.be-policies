We will update this page if we create new social media profiles but we are not operating any other profile not listed here. 

Our policy is to never reach out to users via private messages. 
If you receive a message from any Mimic team member asking you to click on a link, submit information, or anything else suspicious, it is a scam.

Mimic and our team will never ask you for money/cryptocurrencies or important private information.

If you have been contacted by someone from Mimic, please verify by sending us a message to one of our social media platforms above.
